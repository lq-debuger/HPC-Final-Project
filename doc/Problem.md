# Problem
We consider the transient heat equation in a one-dimensional (1D) domain Ω := (0, 1). The boundary of the domain is Γ = {0, 1}. Let $f$ be the heat supply per unit volume, $u$ be the temperature, $\rho$ be the density, $c$ be the heat capacity, $u_0$ be the initial temperature, $κ$ be the conductivity, $n_x$ be the Cartesian components of the unit outward normal vector . The boundary data involves the prescribed temperature $g$ on $Γ_g$ and heat flux $h$ on $Γ_h$. The boundary $Γ$ admits a non-overlapping decomposition: $Γ = \overline{Γ_g ∪ Γ_h}$ and ∅ = Γ_g ∩ Γ_h. The transient heat equation may be stated as follows.
$$
\rho c\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-k\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=f\quad\text{on $\Omega\times(0,T)$}\\
u=g\quad\text{on $Γ_g\times(0,T)$}\\
k\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}n_x=h\quad\text{on $Γ_h\times(0,T)$}\\
u|_t=u_0\quad\text{in $\Omega$}
